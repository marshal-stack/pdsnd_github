**INTRODUCTION**
My name is **Onyeagba Okechukwu** and I will be talking briefly about my project.
first I will like to say that it gave me quite a head but I am happy that
at least from my point of view, it seems to be working. The project dealt
with data from bike renting platforms from three locations in the united states
namely: **Chicago, Washington and New York City**

**AIM**
This will be to write a code that will answer users question based on the data
acquired, meaning that irrespective of the selected location, month or day.
The user gets some answers to specified questions.

**SOFTWARES**
I used Atom for my code editing and command line interface(git-bash) to run
my codes. you can get help on setting this up [by viewing udacity course on
programing with python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

**Approach**
when I open the file and after like hours of thinking. I thought about an
approach in which I divided the work to be done into 
3 parts
1) to get user input
2) to parse it to the load function
3) to solve for the calculations
you can have a look at this in more details in the [python file](https://github.com/marshal-stack/pdsnd_github/commit/d3a0ba763e8e96afacd653f32ceb9d0f76f1be0d)
