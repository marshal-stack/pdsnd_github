**INTRODUCTION**
My name is **Onyeagba Okechukwu** and I will be talking briefly about my project.
first I will like to say that it gave me quite a head but I am happy that
at least from my point of view, it seems to be working. The project dealt
with data from bike renting platforms from three locations in the united states
namely: **Chicago, Washington and New York City**

**AIM**
This will be to write a code that will answer users question based on the data
acquired, meaning that irrespective of the selected location, month or day.
The user gets some answers to specified questions.
